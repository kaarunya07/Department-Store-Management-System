# Department-Store-Management-System
This Java project simulates a Department Store System which handles various operations such as managing inventory, customer purchases, and product listings. It is a console-based application using core Java concepts like classes, lists, and maps.


The system is built around the following primary components:

Product Class: Stores attributes of a product like name, tag, item code, description, price, and quantity.

Inventory Management: Uses collections like ArrayList and HashMap to manage and search products.

User Interaction: Uses a Scanner for user input to allow operations like adding, updating, and viewing products, as well as handling purchases.



Important and Noticeable Points
Object-Oriented Design:

The system follows OOP principles by encapsulating product-related data in a Product class.

Data Structures:

Uses ArrayList for storing product lists and HashMap for quick product lookup by item code.

CRUD Functionality:

Likely supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing inventory (common in store systems).

Inventory Control:

Tracks stock availability using a quantity attribute. It likely prevents purchases if items are out of stock.

Search Capability:

Use of tags and item codes suggests searchable inventory features.

Console-Based UI:

Interaction via console menusâ€”suitable for basic simulations and educational purposes.

Scalability for Features:

The structure can be extended to include more features such as billing, admin logins, or database connectivity.
